# Dynamic-Class-Schedule-Web-Services

This project is designed to provide practice in building database-backed web services, implementing authentication and authorization in Tomcat using realms. The primary objective is to create a simple Web API that allows authenticated JSU (Java State University) users to interact with the Spring 2024 course schedule. Users can search for classes, register for courses, view their registrations, and cancel their registrations. The project emphasizes server-side components, and there is no client-side component involved.
